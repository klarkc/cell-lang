Overview
The 'Cell Language' project focuses on a mathematical programming language for theorem proving using natural number permutations as its computational foundation, introduced by Tobias Andersen.

Cantor's diagonalization creates a bijection between natural numbers and pairs for integer representation, forming the basis for mathematical statement proving within the language.

Recursive functions are initially limited to natural number inputs, referencing GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem to establish mathematical frameworks.

Python implementation facilitates expression parsing with evaluate() and reduce() functions, demonstrating recursive definitions with a structured example.

Key components missing from the project include integer implementation and proof syntax integration, which are crucial for enhancing the existing framework.

The project deliberately avoids advanced tools like AGDA to maintain clarity in mathematical concepts, encouraging handwritten code for thesis testing.

Walker Leite proposed using AGDA for one-to-one correspondence implementation, highlighting its documentation and type inference capabilities.

A commitment was made to produce a PowerPoint presentation and video to explain project requirements and flow more effectively.

Initial collaboration will involve a basic package consultation to clarify project understanding and ensure effective communication.

An initial meeting is scheduled to align on project goals and expectations, with a focus on enhancing understanding of the codebase.
